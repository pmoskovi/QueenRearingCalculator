-4, OPTIONAL: Timing the age of the larva, OPTIONAL: Place the donor queen on a drawn comb in a <a href="https://www.betterbee.com/queen-rearing-supplies/FIC1-Deep-Frame-Isolation-Cage.asp">frame isolation cage</a>. This will ensure right-aged larvae to graft from.

0, Preparations, Pick a strong double-deep colony that you'll use.
0, Find donor frame,Identify the donor frame with 1-day old larva <br/> (in the same or different hive).
0, Find the queen,Locate your queen; you'll have to put her the upper box.
0, Create queenless cell-starter configuration, Build your cell starter as follows bottom-to-top: <ol><li>Bottom board-hive entrance direction unchanged</li><li>Lower box with frame feeder <br/> 2 frames of pollen with graft frame in between</br>Shake bees into bottom box from brood frames in the upper box</li><li>Place double screen (Snelgrove) board with entrance for the upper box open to the REAR (this will ensure the field bees join the lower box with the freshly grafted cells) </li><li>Upper deep box with queen and all the brood frames</li></ol>
0, Grafting, Graft the larvae and place grafted frame in lower box between pollen frames.
1, Box rotation, Rotate the two boxes. This will move the frame with previously grafted cells in the upper box.
1, Move up two frames of open brood, Move up two frames of open brood (e.g.: the donor frame) in the upper box. New frame order: feeder | pollen | open brood | cell frame | open brood | pollen.
1, Fill empty slots with frames in the lower box, Add empty frames to the lower box to replace the ones you moved in the upper box.
1, Add an empty frame or two to the upper box, Add a couple of empty frames to the upper box to discourage the bees to build extra comb around the queen cells.
1, Replace double screen board with queen excluder, Separate the two boxes with queen excluder (be sure the queen is down below) - remove double screen board.
4, Cull emergency queen cells, Cull all emergency queen cells from brood cells; virgin queens may slip through the queen excluder and sting your queen cells.
9, Nuc preparations - phase 1, Move the frames that go to nucs above brood boxes; separated by queen excluder (shake bees off)
10, Nuc preparations - phase 2, Create nuc boxes with frames moved above queen excluder the previous day. We'll introduce the queen cells into these queenless nucs the next day.
11, Harvesting queen cells, Introduce queen cells into the previously created nucs.
